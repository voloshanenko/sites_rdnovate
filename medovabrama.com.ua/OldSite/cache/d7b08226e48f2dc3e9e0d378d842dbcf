			<title>Security Talk: Fortifying Your Joomla! Website</title>
			<link>http://www.sigsiu.net/latest_news/security_talk_fortifying_your_joomla_website.html</link>
			<description>Even if Joomla! is one of the safest Content Management Systems available, Joomla! Websites get hacked every day.
Just because you are using Joomla!, don't think your site is safe. Actually, you are opening yourself up to a potential security risk since Joomla! relies on PHP and a MySQL database instead of static html pages.

Those of you who plan to attend Security Talk (http://jandbeyond.org/radek-suski.html).

As a website owner you may not think much about security, and just assume your hosting company takes care of it.
But in this case, you may be in for a rude awakening.
Unfortunately there are lots of myths and misleading information about dynamic websites and webserver security that need to be recognized and clarified.

Based on my experience as a developer and server administrator, I was able to extend my theoretical knowledge in this field and create an efficient security system to protect webservers.
At the same time, as a developer of Joomla! extensions, I learned which mistakes Joomla! users do most often.
Fact is, most users are only familiar with Desktop PC and client software but Internet software is an entirely different animal.

In this talk I would like to share with you my firsthand knowledge and real world experience I've gained over the years to show how you can easily improve the security of your Joomla website.
It doesn't have to be complicated, you just need to know what to look for, and how to stay proactive in setting up a safe hosting environment.

If you haven't gotten your tickets yet, be sure to visit the site as there is only room for about 250 people and they have sold a lot of tickets already!
