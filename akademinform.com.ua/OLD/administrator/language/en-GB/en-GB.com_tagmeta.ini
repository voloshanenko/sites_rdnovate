TAG META ABOUT DESC=Tag Meta allows to efficiently manage site's meta tags. It allows you to set tag 'title' and meta tags 'description', 'keywords' and 'robots' on each page, which is identified by the URI or a part of it. This provides a powerful tool to improve site positioning in SEO optimization. Tag Meta consists of a component to manage URI list, and a plugin that is in charge of setting the meta info on the page.<br /><br /><b>Usage:</b><br /><ul><li>Install the component and the plugin using Joomla! administration interface</li><li>Activate plugin 'System - Tag Meta' and set global parameters</li><li>Use Tag Meta component's functions to manage meta info</li></ul>List of URI configured using the component are compared by plugin with the URI of the current page in the chosen ordering, and the first matching item found is applied. Configured items can be full URI or parts of them. For example, if the configured URI item is '<b>/home.html</b>' it matches both the address <b>http://www.mysite.com/home.html</b> and the address <b>http://www.mysite.com/orders/home.html?view=status</b>.<br /><br />Is it also possible to use regular expressions according to Henry Spencer's implementation:<br /><br /><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html" target="_blank">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html</a><br /><br />These are some examples:<br /><br /><b>/section/*$</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The address ends with /section or /section/<br /><br /><b>/section/9-article.html</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The address ends exactly with /section/9-article.html<br /><br />Remember to use meaningful descriptions for title and description, concerning the content of the pages, and to insert comma separated keywords with no spaces.<br /><br />Finally, it is recommended to use native Joomla! SEO options, to simplify the structure of the site's URLs, improving both page positioning, and meta info management to associate to each URI.
